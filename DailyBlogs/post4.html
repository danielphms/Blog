    We just wrapped up our first sectionals!
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    We went 0-3 in our pool, and yeah, that stings a bit. One of those losses was against Emory’s A team,
    who ended up winning our entire pool and the gold bracket. Playing against a team like that was tough, but it also showed us what the next level looks like.

    Even though we didn’t come close to qualifying for nationals,
    I know everyone on our team gave it everything they had. We’re still growing, still figuring things out, and this was just one step along the way.

    I’m taking it as motivation and not a setback. We learned a lot, and that’s what really matters. Next time we come back stronger. I'm so proud of my team &lt;3
