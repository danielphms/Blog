  It’s the original crew who started the tennis club. That’s me in the middle, and as of now, I’m the only one still here.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    When Shreyas (on the far left) asked me back in high school if I wanted to help start a tennis club, I honestly didn’t 
    know what to think. I didn’t play tennis. I had never really even considered it. But I said yes anyway. I stepped out of my comfort zone, 
    picked up a racket, and decided to give something completely new a shot.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Looking back now, I had no idea how far this would take me. I had no clue that something as simple as saying “sure, why not?” would lead to countless
    memories, early mornings on the court, road trips, wins, losses, and lifelong friendships.
  </p>  
  <br>
  <p>
    Starting this club was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. And to anyone out there wondering if they should take that leap, DO IT. 
    You never know where it’ll take you.
