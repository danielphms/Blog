  <p>
    This project started with me trying to revive an old desktop I found. It's was a Windows XP from 2006 that my brother had in his room. I had dreams of turning
    it into a lightweight server. It almost worked‚Ä¶ until I realized the BIOS didn‚Äôt support USB booting üò©. My only option was to burn a DVD. 
    I stared at the DVD drive. It stared back. I gave up. So I pivoted to a Raspberry Pi 4, and honestly, it was the better call.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Hardware Setup:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
    <li>Micro SSD but using a USB to boot 
    <li>External HDD for storage 
    <li>Unmanaged Ethernet Switch (TP-Link TL-SG105)
    <li>Powerline adapter (TP-Link AV1000)
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3>My Problems:</h3>

  <p>
    My room is a wifi deadzone, so I used to powerline adapter that I already had and pluged it into the switch. Now, the switch is being used to connect ethernet to my 
    RaspberryPi and main desktop. Setting this up wasn‚Äôt easy. First, the boot didn‚Äôt actually clone correctly from the USB to SSD, so the Pi would just vanish from the network 
    when I unplug the USB.

  <strong>Before:</strong>

  <strong>After:</strong>
  <img src="../images/homelab2.jpg" alt="homelab" style="display: block; margin-top: 0.3em; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">

  <h3>What‚Äôs Next?:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to host this site on the RaspberryPi</li>
    <li>Container more apps via Portainer</li>
    <li>Maybe circling back to that old XP machine‚Ä¶ someday.üò≠</li>
  </ul>

    Final look of what my homelab looks like. The HDD isnt connected because its the wrong cable. üòÅ
